# tic_tac_toe_with_react

My first project with REACT! Further to exploring ideas for my final Makers project, i wanted to trial some of the features of react to see if it could be implemented for the front end. I used t=an offical REACT walkthrough (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to get to grips with the syntx and to play with some of the features.
