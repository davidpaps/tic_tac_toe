# Tic Tac Toe (using React)

This was my first project using the JavaScript Library React. It has been 10 days since finishing the Makers Academy now, and through my jobhunts, I have noticed that almost every role that i look for has React in it's tech stack. I therefore thought I would start to get familiar with some of the key features of this library.

I thought a good place to start would be to use the official React [*docs*](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and make a basic game of Tic Tac Toe (Noughts and Crosses for the Europeans!).

__The game features the following functionalities:__

- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
